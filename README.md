# TaskTracker 
The project files are in Task folder

TaskTracker is a class project. It was developed in a team of four.
Idea-
The application aims at helping the roommates to keep track of their household responsibilities. By using this application, roommates can assign tasks to eachother and to themselves. To keep the amount of work fair, i.e to check the work ethic of each roommate, a graph is generated at the end of each week. The graph shows the weekly points (obtained by completing the assigned tasks) and the overdue tasks of the group. To keep the work distributed fairly points for a given task change based on the order in which it was selected (keeping in mind that easy tasks are chosen and are completed more often than the harder tasks). This gives each roommate a fair chance to complete easy and the hard tasks.

My contribution:

- Was part of the database modelling phase of the project.
- Designed and developed the UI of the application.
- Developed JSP servlets to call the database and display correct results.
- Was part of the data visualization phase of the project.
- Developing test cases and testing the application using Mockito framework.
